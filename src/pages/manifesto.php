                    1. People suck, and they suck a lot. If you can avoid them,
                    now that doesn't mean be a dick and not interact with people
                    when they interact with you. This also doesn't mean an individual
                    person sucks. But a group will always suck. Try not to rely
                    on them. Just remember the little mantra, the more people
                    involved the more chances to mess up.
                    <br>

                    2. Learn. If you aren't doing anything go learn something.
                    Don't be selective with your learning either. If it is something
                    to be learned then learn it. Don't be opposed to learn anything.
                    The choice not to learn is the choice to be ignorant.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Get off social media. It ain't doing you know good. Media
                    streaming sites like Youtube is kind of a gray area. I think
                    you should be able to tell if you are using it for good or not.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Learn to be alone. Maybe go out and do LSD or something.
                    Im not here to tell you how to live your life. So honestly
                    this whole thing kind of goes against my own beliefs. So listen
                    to this or don't. These are just recommendations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5. Do whatever your heart desires. Drugs, People, Crimes it's
                    your life. Do what you want when you want and how you want to.
                    That being said, take care of your body. Don't be a fat fuck
                    or do. It is your body after all but honestly who wants to be
                    fat? Seriously?
