# City of the Dead

This is a website. No real theme, just simplicity I guess. Websites suck nowadays
thanks to Javascript. So with all due respect I hate you Brendan Eich and Ryan Dahl.

My goal for this website is to put anything that I thought was a good website into this.
A.K.A. 90's - 00's websites because they were simple, elegant and creative.
They didn't take shit from anybody lol. Another goal is to go completely without
Javascript. I don't want a single line of JS if I can prevent it. You don't need
it to make a good dynamic website. What you need is actual fucking thoughts not
a language built in a week on shitty fucking ideas. Looking at you unpull().
